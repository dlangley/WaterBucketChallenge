# Water Bucket Game
Project Developed by Dwayne Langley

A childrens puzzle
- Given 2 buckets with varying capacities, can you figure out how to get a target number of gallons exactly?


## Directions
Use the following combination of actions to reach the target on the horizon.
- Drag a bucket into the water to fill it...
- Drag a bucket into the other bucket to transfer water from one to another...
- Drag a bucket up or off the screen to empty it...


## TODO
0. Implement the efficiency validator in the Game class.
1. Create a proper settings menu
2. Animate the water
3. Implement player profiles
4. Socialize

## Story
- This is a pretty quick implementation for some random interview.  However, this may actually be useful for some friends of mine who are educators, so I'll probably release it for them to use.'
